NS3-based Simulation of a Computer Network
simulation of a computer network using NS3. The simulated network consists of 7 hosts and 4 routers interconnected using point-to-point links. The aim is to evaluate network performance in terms of throughput, packet drops, delays, and queue lengths. Visualization of the packet flow is performed using NetAnim.
